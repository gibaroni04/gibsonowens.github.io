            Born and raised in the serene woods of rural Michigan, where the natural beauty of my surroundings profoundly shaped my artistic vision. From a young age, I found solace and inspiration in the lush forests, tranquil lakes, and the symphony of wildlife that surrounded my home.

My love for nature and music has been the cornerstone of my creative journey. My art is a blend of these influences, capturing the essence of the natural world through various mediums. Whether it's painting, writing, photography, or digital art, my work reflects my deep connection to the environment and my passion for exploring all forms of artistic expression.

I refuse to be confined to a single medium; I thrive on experimentation and discovery. My portfolio is a testament to versatility, and each piece is an exploration of texture, color, and form, showcasing the beauty of boundless creativity and dedication.
